Ellipsoid body with a protruding ellipsoid part.
Rendered in Blender (3D mesh wrapped in random-dot texture)

“nonrig len change as ori change.mp4” – protruding part is non-rigidly changing in length as the whole object rotates back and forth. The non-rigid length change is perceived as a (part-wise) non-rigid orientation change.

“nonrig len dec as horz ang.mp4” – protruding part now visible in silhouette. Again, non-rigidly changing in length (decreasing) as the whole object rotates. This time interpreted as a rigid part with a fixed horizontal orientation (pointed away from the observer) with respect to the body.
“nonrig len inc as horz ang.mp4” – protruding part now visible in silhouette. Again, non-rigidly changing in length (increasing) as the whole object rotates. This time interpreted as a rigid part with a fixed horizontal orientation (pointed towards the observer) with respect to the body.

Demonstrates bias towards reinterpretations of non-rigid part-length change. Part-orientation change is more common in animate motion (e.g., articulation of limbs), whereas part-length change is not. May suggest that the visual system is biased towards biologically plausible transformations.
