Square plane with parts in the upper-left and lower-right quadrants.
The shape of the part could be half Ellipsoids or bivariate Gaussians.
Parts can either be Concave or Convex.
Projection can be Orthographic or Perspective.
Degree of angular rotation (about its central vertical axis) is either 30 or 20 degrees (in these demos).

Percept: When one region is concave and the other is convex, the plane is often seen as moving non-rigidly (“folding” under orthographic projection; “bending” under perspective projection) with both parts convex. Breaks the rigidity assumption that if there is a rigid interpretation (in this case a plane with concave and convex parts rotating rigidly) the visual system will take that interpretation.
Interaction of priors for convexity and rigidity.
